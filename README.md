Backbone v1.4.1
===============

A simple to use HTML, LESS/CSS and JavaScript/jQuery responsive framework (or foundation/boilerplate) to help with rapid protyping and development of websites for use on Desktop, Laptops, Tablets and Mobile devices.

**Demo:** http://www.cloud-eight.com/github/backbone/


Usage
======

<ul>
  <li>Please refer to the demo page for documentation</li>
</ul>

  <li>Firefox</li>
  <li>Chrome</li>
  <li>Safari</li>
  <li>Opera</li>
