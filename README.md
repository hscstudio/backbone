Backbone v1.3
=============

A simple to use HTML, LESS/CSS and JavaScript/jQuery responsive framework (or foundation/boilerplate) to help with rapid protyping and development of websites for use on Desktop, Laptops, Tablets and Mobile devices.

**Demo:** http://www.cloud-eight.com/github/backbone/


Usage
======

<ul>
  <li>Please refer to the demo page for documentation</li>
</ul>


Browser Compatibility
=====================

<ul>
  <li>IE 8+</li>
  <li>Firefox</li>
  <li>Chrome</li>
  <li>Safari</li>
  <li>Opera</li>
  <li>Most mobile browsers</li>
</ul>

Note that IE 8 and older browsers will fail to load 'less.min.js'. Once all LESS files have been compiled to CSS and your workflow is in production mode it will work correctly.
