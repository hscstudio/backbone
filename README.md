A simple to use HTML, LESS/CSS and JavaScript/jQuery responsive framework (or foundation/boilerplate) to help with rapid protyping and development of websites for use on Desktop, Laptops, Tablets and Mobile devices.

**Demo:** http://www.cloud-eight.com/github/backbone/demo/

  </ul>


Browser Compatibility
=====================

IE 8+<br />
Firefox<br />

Note that IE 8 will fail to load 'less.min.js', once all LESS files have been compiled and your workflow is in production mode it will work in IE 8.
